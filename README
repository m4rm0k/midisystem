bilotrip - majestic twelve

4th @ combined demo competition
assembly 2013 multi media convention, helsinki, finland

cracked and trained for *NIX by ccr/TNSP^pwp

compatible with 32/64-bit linux systems (hopefully)


build requirements:
	- gcc / g++ 4.6+
	- binutils
	- GNU Make
	- CMake 2.8

	- libboost 1.5x system and thread dev
	- libtheora 1.1.x dev
	- OpenGL libs
	- GLEW 1.6+ (works with 1.7 at least)
	- FreeGLUT (2.8 tested)
	- FreeType2

how to build:
	0) debian/ubuntu lollers:

	$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake

	$ sudo apt-get install libglew-dev \
	libboost1.54-dev libboost-system1.54-dev \
	libboost-thread1.54-dev libfreetype6-dev \
	freeglut3-dev libtheora-dev


	1) optionally edit Makefile


	2) then

	$ make build32
	OR
	$ make build64
	
	unpacks and builds the included libraries and
	the demo, if all goes well. you MUST use the
	correct build, for 32 or 64-bit respectively
	due to the libbass binary blob dependency.


	2b) $ make
	attempts to build the demo only (for debugging)


	3) run the wrapper script to run the demo:

	$ ./demo

have a nice torment,
ccr signing off
